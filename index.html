            Solar radiation, often called the solar resource or just sunlight,
            is a general term for the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the
            sun. Solar radiation can be captured and turned into useful forms of
            energy, such as heat and electricity, using a variety of
            technologies. However, the technical feasibility and economical
            operation of these technologies at a specific location depends on
            the available solar resource.

            IC 1101 is the largest galaxy in the observable universe. This
            supergiant elliptical galaxy is estimated to be around 2000 times
            larger than our Milky Way Galaxy, and also sports the largest known
            supermassive black hole known to man. This awe-inspiring black hole
            is likely what generates the bright radio signal emitted from the
            galaxy's center.

            The International Space Station is an orbiting space laboratory,
            assembled through a decades-long collaboration of countries. The
            360-ton space station is larger than a five-bedroom house -- just
            much longer and narrower. It has enough room for six sleeping
            quarters, a gym, a 360-degree viewing window, and areas to conduct a
            wide array of science experiments. "We've had continuous human
            presence on the space station for 19 years now," said NASA
            spokeswoman Stephanie Schierholz. "It is an unprecedented
            international collaboration among nations."

            A nebula is an enormous cloud of dust and gas occupying the space
            between stars and acting as a nursery for new stars. The roots of
            the word come from Latin nebula, which means a “mist, vapor, fog,
            smoke, exhalation.” Nebulae are made up of dust, basic elements such
            as hydrogen and other ionized gases. They either form through clouds
            of cold interstellar gas and dust or through the aftermath of a
            supernova. For example, in the Carina Nebula, hot, young stars erode
            and sculpt the clouds into this fantasy landscape by sending out
            thick stellar winds and scorching ultraviolet radiation. The
            low-density regions of the nebula are shredded while the denser
            parts resist erosion and remain as thick pillars.

            The boiling new world, which zips around its star at ultraclose
            range, is among the lightest exoplanets found to date.
            Ultra-short-period planets are small, compact worlds that whip
            around their stars at close range, completing an orbit — and a
            single, scorching year — in less than 24 hours. How these planets
            came to be in such extreme configurations is one of the continuing
            mysteries of exoplanetary science. Now, astronomers have discovered
            an ultra-short-period planet (USP) that is also super light. The
            planet is named GJ 367 b, and it orbits its star in just eight
            hours. The planet is about the size of Mars, and half as massive as
            the Earth, making it one of the lightest planets discovered to date.

            Black holes are some of the strangest and most fascinating objects
            in outer space. They're extremely dense, with such strong
            gravitational attraction that even light cannot escape their grasp
            if it comes near enough. Albert Einstein first predicted the
            existence of black holes in 1916, with his general theory of
            relativity. The term "black hole" was coined many years later in
            1967 by American astronomer John Wheeler. After decades of black
            holes being known only as theoretical objects, the first physical
            black hole ever discovered was spotted in 1971. Then, in 2019 the
            Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration released the first image
            ever recorded of a black hole. The EHT saw the black hole in the
            center of galaxy M87 while the telescope was examining the event
            horizon, or the area past which nothing can escape from a black
            hole. The image maps the sudden loss of photons (particles of
            light). It also opens up a whole new area of research in black
            holes, now that astronomers know what a black hole looks like.
